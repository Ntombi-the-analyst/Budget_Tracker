# Budget_Tracker
My first Python project – a Budget Tracker in Jupyter Notebook to manage income, expenses, and savings with visual reports.

# How It Started
I wanted to build something practical as my very first Python project. 
Since managing money is part of everyday life, I decided to create a Budget Tracker that could record income, expenses, and savings. 
This project became both a coding exercise and a personal finance tool.

# What I Learned
While building this project, I learned how to:
Work with pandas to clean and structure financial data.
Use matplotlib & seaborn to create simple but powerful charts.
Write Python code that is reusable, readable, and structured.
Document my work in Jupyter Notebook so it’s easy to follow.

# What It Can Do
Track income and expenses with categories like Food, Rent, Transport, etc.
Provide monthly and yearly summaries.
Visualize spending patterns with charts.
Show savings trends over time.

# Future Plans
Since this is my first project, it’s simple — but I want to improve it by:
Adding a database to store transactions.
Building a web dashboard for easier interaction.
Adding predictive analysis to forecast expenses.

# Why This Project Matters
This project represents the beginning of my journey as a Python programmer and data enthusiast. 
It’s a small step, but it shows how I can take an idea, turn it into code, and make it useful.
